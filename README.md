# Focus areas
I primarily focused on the architecture and infrastructure sides of the app. I kept UI simple 
since the task suggested using standard components. 

As the architecture I selected MVVM since it allows for View and logic de-coupling 
which improves testability (we can write lightweight unit tests and run them more often),
scalability (if code is testable and structured - we can easily add to it),
maintainability (if code is structured it is usually easier to read) along with 
pluggability (since code is layers we can replace pieces and bits easier)

# Target device

I focused on a phone portrait but the orientation is not locked to it. I have not created a dedicated UI version for tablet or extra-large screen.
urs as requested. It was enough time to complete the task.

# PS

I have left notes throughout the project to explain my thought process and dependency choice.
